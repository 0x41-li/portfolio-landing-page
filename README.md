### A Website Portfolio Project 
I build this website using old school layout, to take an experience and understand how websites were built, and what are the challenges with this approach, using float, position, and box model as basic layout properties.
I did use JavaScript for some tweaks, such as the fixed header, the mobile's menu logo, and animations.
The HTML was from the first place structured, in a way that reduces the headache later.

## pros
Of course, the browser compatibility, performance, speed, and all web core vitals, I mean it's really useful if you have a website, that has a lot of traffic, and a lot of users, that use old browsers, which I don't think people still use them according to statistics.

## cons
A lot of work, especially on CSS, a lot of media queries, the CSS file will be large but not too much.
